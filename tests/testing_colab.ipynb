For now, let's address your task related to the containers.\n\nWhen you immerse your right hand in container A (room temperature water) and your left hand in container C (reasonably hot water), after one minute, both hands will be at about the same temperature as the water they were in. Now, when you bring them both into container B (which has a mixture of room temperature and hot water), here's what happens:\n\n- Your right hand, which was initially in cooler water, will feel warmer because it is now immersed in water that is a bit hotter than its current temperature.\n- Your left hand, which was initially in hotter water, will feel cooler because it is now immersed in water that is a bit cooler than its current temperature.\n\nThis phenomenon occurs due to the thermal equilibrium your hands reach with their respective containers and then experience when moved to container B. The key idea here is how the temperature of objects changes based on the surrounding environment.\n\nNow, let's move on to another topic you mentioned: lenses!\n\nDo you have any questions about lenses or would you like me to explain more about them?"
